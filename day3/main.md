## 🧠 Day 3 — Functions & Logical Thinking in Python

### 📘 Concepts Covered
- Function definition using `def`
- Passing arguments and returning values
- Using returned values as inputs for other functions
- Logical linking between multiple functions
- Beginner list handling (creating, appending, and iterating)

---

### 💻 Programs Built
1. **Grade Calculator (Simple Version)**  
   - Asked user for number of subjects  
   - Calculated average marks using a function  
   - Displayed grade using conditional logic  
   - Learned function return and function chaining

2. **List-Based Student Grader**  
   - Created a list dynamically with marks for each subject  
   - Wrote a function to calculate total and average from the list  
   - Practiced iterating over list elements and returning results

---

### 🧩 Key Learnings
- Functions help keep code modular, reusable, and clean  
- Data can flow between functions via parameters and return values  
- Lists simplify handling multiple inputs dynamically  
- Understanding “how data travels” between functions improves logic building  

---

### 🧠 Reflection
> “Today I explored how functions interact with each other and how lists store data.  
> Python feels intuitive — the more I focus on logic and structure, the more natural the syntax becomes.”

---

### 🚀 Next Steps (for Day 4)
- Strengthen function-list interaction  
- Practice modular problem solving  
- Build a multi-function mini-project combining all previous learnings
