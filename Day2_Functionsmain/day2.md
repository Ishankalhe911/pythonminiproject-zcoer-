# Day 2 - Python Basics (Functions & Conditionals)

## Topics Covered
- If-Else and Nested Conditions
- Basic Functions (parameters, return)
- Practice Programs (prime number, calculator)


### 🎯 Objective
To strengthen the core understanding of Python basics — input/output, conditionals, and loops — through a logical and creative hands-on mini project.

---

### 📘 Concepts Covered
- **Input/Output** — Taking user input and displaying dynamic responses.  
- **Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)** — Making decisions based on logic.  
- **Loops (`for`)** — Repetition and controlled iterations.  
- **Variables & Data Types** — Handling strings, integers, and counters.  
- **Error Handling (Basic)** — Preventing invalid access through logical boundaries.

---

### 🧩 Mini Project — *Research Facility Access System*
A small yet logical system that simulates a secure facility entry mechanism.

**Features:**
- Asks for user name, age, and a secret access code.  
- Validates age (must be 18 or above).  
- Allows three attempts for entering the correct code.  
- Locks the system after failed attempts.

### 💡 Learning Reflection
This task helped in:
- Reinforcing the **flow of control** in Python.  
- Understanding how **logic and syntax** align perfectly.  
- Boosting confidence in building small, meaningful programs from scratch.  
- Realizing that **logic + creativity > syntax alone** — because once logic is clear, syntax flows naturally.
