📘 Day 5 — Python Coding Session Summary
🔹 What I Practised Today

Day 5 was focused heavily on Python fundamentals, especially:

Using lists efficiently

Writing functions with parameters & return values

Understanding Python loops vs C/CPP loops

Combining logic + functions to solve real problems

✅ Programs Completed Today
1. Square Finder

Took a number from user

Returned its square using a function

2. Marks Appending Program

Asked user for number of subjects

Took marks input and stored them in a list

Learned how lists grow dynamically

3. Summation of Marks

Wrote a function that iterates directly on list values

Calculated and returned the total marks

Understood difference between index-based loop and value-based loop

4. Topper Finder (Major Program of Day 5)

Created two parallel lists:

names

marks

Wrote a function to:

Traverse list

Compare marks

Track highest score and corresponding student

Returned topper’s name + marks

This was the biggest logic-building exercise of the day

5. Debugging Question

Fixed a bug in a provided function

Learned why “for i in list” gives values, not indexes

Used correct summation logic

🚧 Mini Project Started Today: ATM System

You began building a small ATM system logic:

Created account names and PIN list

Took user name input

Authentication concept started

Tomorrow:

withdraw

deposit

check balance

user-specific balance handling

loop until user wants to exit

🎯 What I Learned Today

Python loops are highly simplified vs C/C++

Direct iteration on lists is more natural in Python

Functions help clean up logic

How to work with multiple lists together (names + marks)

Basic debugging in Python

🔥 Overall Progress

Day 5 was a high-load logic day, covering:

5 problem-solving questions

1 mini-project start

A lot of revision of loops, lists, and functions
