it's day 4
## 🧩 Day 4 — Python: Functions + Lists (Two-List Mapping)

### 🎯 Concept
Today’s focus was to deepen the understanding of **functions** and explore how to **link data indirectly** using multiple lists.

Instead of complex data structures, the goal was to logically connect **student names** with their **marks** using parallel lists — a foundational concept that leads to dictionaries and database-like thinking.

---

### 💡 Problem Statement
Create a program that:
1. Asks the user for the number of students.  
2. Takes each student’s **name** and **marks** as input.  
3. Stores names in one list and marks in another.  
4. Displays both lists clearly.  
5. Calculates and displays the **average marks** of the class.  

*(Hint: Use functions for modularity — one for data entry, one for average calculation.)*

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Strengthened grasp of **functions** and how data flows through parameters and return values.  
- Learned how **parallel lists** can represent linked data structures.  
- Reinforced thinking around **structured programming**, a key skill before diving into dictionaries or OOP.  
- Practiced writing clean, modular, and logical Python code.  

---

### 🧱 Next Step (for Tomorrow)
- Continue with **functions and list manipulations**.  
- Explore **passing lists between functions**, and later move to **dictionaries** for direct key-value mapping.

**🔥 Core Mindset Reminder:**  
> Don’t just write syntax — *design logic like a system builder.*
