## 🧩 Day 4 — Python: Functions + Lists (Two-List Mapping)

### 🎯 Concept
Today’s focus was to deepen the understanding of **functions** and explore how to **link data indirectly** using multiple lists.

Instead of complex data structures, the goal was to logically connect **student names** with their **marks** using parallel lists — a foundational concept that leads to dictionaries and database-like thinking.

---

### 💡 Problem Statement
Create a program that:
1. Asks the user for the number of students.  
2. Takes each student’s **name** and **marks** as input.  
3. Stores names in one list and marks in another.  
4. Displays both lists clearly.  
5. Calculates and displays the **average marks** of the class.  

*(Hint: Use functions for modularity — one for data entry, one for average calculation.)*

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Strengthened grasp of **functions** and how data flows through parameters and return values.  
- Learned how **parallel lists** can represent linked data structures.  
- Reinforced thinking around **structured programming**, a key skill before diving into dictionaries or OOP.  
- Practiced writing clean, modular, and logical Python code.  

---

### 🧱 Next Step (for Tomorrow)
- Continue with **functions and list manipulations**.  
- Explore **passing lists between functions**, and later move to **dictionaries** for direct key-value mapping.

# 🚀 Day 4 — Traditional Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

## 🎯 Focus
Understanding core Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and their relevance in cyber threat detection and defense systems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

1. **Decision Tree (DT)**
   - Works on labeled data using rule-based branching (if–else logic).
   - Efficient and interpretable but may miss deeper patterns due to greedy nature.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Classifies data by finding the optimal boundary (hyperplane).
   - Commonly used for distinguishing between safe and risky network behavior.

3. **Naive Bayes (NB)**
   - Uses probabilities of each feature independently (hence *Naive*).
   - Effective for spam filtering, malware detection, and risk classification.

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points.
   - Useful for discovering hidden patterns or unknown threats in raw data.

5. **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**
   - Detects *hidden states* in sequential data.
   - Applied in intrusion detection systems to uncover stealthy, time-based attacks.

6. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
   - Uses mutation and selection to iteratively find the best defense strategies.
   - Helpful in adaptive security systems and anomaly optimization.

---

## 🧠 Insights

- Built conceptual clarity on how **traditional ML models** power cybersecurity solutions.
- Understood the difference between **supervised** and **unsupervised** approaches in intrusion detection.
- Observed how each algorithm maps to a real-world cyber use case (classification, anomaly detection, optimization).
